# **PCA, t-SNE, and MDS Dimensionality Reduction on Image and Text Data**  

## **INTRODUCTION**  
Dimensionality reduction is a crucial technique in machine learning and data science, especially when dealing with **high-dimensional datasets** such as images and text. This project explores three powerful **dimensionality reduction techniques**:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**  
- **Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**  

These techniques help visualize complex datasets, improve computational efficiency, and enhance the performance of machine learning models.  

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
High-dimensional data poses challenges such as **computational inefficiency, increased model complexity, and difficulty in visualization**. This project aims to:  
- **Apply and compare PCA, t-SNE, and MDS on image and text datasets.**  
- **Analyze their effectiveness in capturing essential data patterns.**  
- **Visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.**  

## **SKILL DEMONSTRATION**  
- **Data Preprocessing for High-Dimensional Data (Images & Text)**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques (PCA, t-SNE, MDS)**  
- **Performance Analysis of Each Method**  

## **DATA SOURCING**  
- **Image Data:** High-dimensional numerical representation of images.  
- **Text Data:** Word embeddings or TF-IDF representations of textual information.  

## **DATA PREPROCESSING**  
- **Standardization & Normalization** (Ensuring all features have equal importance)  
- **Vectorization of Text Data** (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or other embeddings)  
- **Flattening & Reshaping Image Data** for model input  

## **DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION TECHNIQUES**  
### **1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **Identifies the most significant features in the dataset.**  
- **Reduces dimensions while preserving maximum variance.**  
- **Explained Variance Ratio Analysis** to determine optimal components.  

### **2. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**  
- **Captures non-linear structures in the data.**  
- **Useful for visualizing clusters in complex datasets.**  
- **Applied on both image and text data.**  

### **3. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)**  
- **Preserves pairwise distances between data points.**  
- **Used for similarity-based dimensionality reduction.**  
- **Comparison with PCA and t-SNE in terms of efficiency and visualization.**  

## **VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS**  
- **2D & 3D Visualizations of Reduced Dimensions**  
- **Comparison of PCA, t-SNE, and MDS Performance**  
- **Cluster Formation and Interpretation in Each Technique**  

## **CONCLUSION**  
- **PCA efficiently reduces dimensions while preserving variance.**  
- **t-SNE is effective for clustering but computationally expensive.**  
- **MDS retains pairwise distances but may struggle with large datasets.**  
- **Choice of dimensionality reduction depends on dataset complexity and visualization needs.**
